I am currently going through UIUC's GPU Teaching Kit (http://gputeachingkit.hwu.crhc.illinois.edu/) to learn about GPU programming in preparation of my research at Stanford under Professor Kayvon Fatahalian.

This repository will contain any labs or coding I do to play around with CUDA C++

I am also considering looking into pyCUDA later which may also end up in this repository
